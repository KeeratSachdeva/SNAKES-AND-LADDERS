### # Starting the Game :
#### You can play the game by just running "Snakes and Ladders.py" . But it requires "python" and "pygame" to be installed on your system . To install pygame just enter
pip install pygame on cmd/terminal.

#### # ⚠⚠WARNING⚠⚠ : Don't delete any of the files and always keep the data folder in the same folder as of Snakes and Ladders.py . Else the code will give errors and the game will not start .
